INTRODUCTION                                           *mash*

Mash is a motion activated (lol - er, I mean, when you press n/N to
jump to next search match) current search match highlighter. Breaking
that down for you, it highlights the match under the cursor
differently to all the other matches (if you have :set hlsearch
activated). If you don't use hlsearch, then it will still highlight
the current match.

CONFIGURATION                            *mash-configuration*

Mash currently uses the built in Search and IncSearch highlight
groups. Change these if you want to use different colours or
attributes. For example, if you like the limelight:
>
  hi Search term=reverse ctermfg=White ctermbg=DarkGreen guifg=White guibg=DarkGreen
  hi IncSearch term=bold cterm=bold ctermfg=Black ctermbg=DarkGreen gui=bold guifg=LightYellow guibg=DarkGreen
>

IGNORECASE~

Mash respects the current 'ignorecase' option setting.

ISSUES                                          *mash-issues*

Mash fails if the search uses an offset other than start-of-pattern,
like:
>
     /foo/e
<
