INTRODUCTION                                           *mash*

Mash is a motion activated (lol - er, I mean, when you press n/N/#/*/g#/g*)
current search match highlighter. Breaking that down for you, it highlights
the match under the cursor differently to all the other matches (if you have
:set hlsearch activated). If you don't use hlsearch, then it will still
highlight the current match.

                                               *mash-unmash*

Use CTRL-L to clear the current mash highlighting. This can be customised in
|mash-key-maps|.

                                                  *mash-fow*

Mash also provides a Fog of War mode where all non-matched text is greyed out.
Activate the FOW mode with <leader>mf and disable it with <leader>mF. This can be customised in  |mash-key-maps|.

CONFIGURATION                            *mash-configuration*

Mash currently uses the built in Search and IncSearch highlight groups. Change
these if you want to use different colours or attributes. For example, if you
like the limelight:
>
  hi Search term=reverse ctermfg=White ctermbg=DarkGreen guifg=White
  guibg=DarkGreen hi IncSearch term=bold cterm=bold ctermfg=Black
  ctermbg=DarkGreen gui=bold guifg=LightYellow guibg=DarkGreen
<
If you use a dark-grey background, a black FOW is near invisible:
>
  hi MashFOW ctermfg=black ctermbg=none guifg=black guibg=none
<

MASH KEY MAPS                                *mash-key-maps*

You can customise the actual key used to enable and disable Fog of War mode.
For example, to map the |mash-fow| enable key (which is, by default, mapped to
<leader>mf) to <leader>f, put the following in your ~/.vimrc :
>
  nmap <leader>f <Plug>MashFOWEnable
<
The following map targets are available for remapping in your ~/.vimrc :
>
  <Plug>MashFOWEnable    defaults to <leader>mf
  <Plug>MashFOWDisable   defaults to <leader>mF
  <Plug>MashUnMash       defaults to <c-l>
<

IGNORECASE~

Mash respects the current 'ignorecase' option setting.

ISSUES                                          *mash-issues*

Mash fails if the search uses an offset other than start-of-pattern,
like:
>
     /foo/e
<
